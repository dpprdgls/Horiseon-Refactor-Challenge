# <Horiseon Refactor Challenge>

## Description


This project was built to help a marketing agency's website follow accessibility standards and implement search engine optimizations. This was accomplished by changing the source code to include semantic HTML elements. These HTML elements were restructured to follow a logical structure which was independent of styling and positioning. When viewing the icon and image elements, you will now find accissible alt attributes. The heading attributes of this page also fall in sequential order. The title element has also been updated to include a descriptive title of the website.
